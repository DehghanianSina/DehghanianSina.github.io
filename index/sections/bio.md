This is Sina Dehghanian. I would like to introduce myself as a detail-oriented and meticulous Data Analyst. I had the wonderful opportunity to work with world-class international and domestic companies as you can find them in my work experiences. 
Data analysis and business intelligence (BI) are my main areas of expertise. The main activities I performed during my past positions were extracting insights from large amounts of data using SQL, cleaning and summarizing them using various tools, and then visualizing the findings in order to communicate them with product managers, C-levels, and board members. Over the course of my career, I have had great achievements. My remarkable track record ranges from creating data pipelines from scratch as a data engineer to visualizing and communicating business intelligence findings to C-levels and stakeholders as a data analyst.
SQL, Python, Git, and visualization tools are my Swiss Army knife for tackling challenges and creating analytical reports for product managers and board members to take action on to build a great product.

Sina graduated as a master's student in Artificial Intelligence in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the Isfahan University of Technology (IUT). Under the supervision of Dr. Manshaei at Game Theory & Mechanism Design Research Lab [(GTMD)](https://gtmd.iut.ac.ir/en/alumni-0).
