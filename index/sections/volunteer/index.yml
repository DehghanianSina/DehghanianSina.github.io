      It is clear that in the first year, first-year students need to be supported in both academic aspects and social fields. In this plan, the senior or junior B.Sc. students help the freshmen during their entrance of the university. I have been a member of this committee for two courses of holding. Some of my activities include holding orientation days, supporting and mentoring first-year students, scheduling and holding different kinds of workshops, holding scientific visits, and managing the meetings with professors.
